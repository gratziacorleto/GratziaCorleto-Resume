        <div class="subheading mb-5">AnthropologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Gratzia Corleto Estevez, I am currently a second year anthropology major at the University of California, Riverside. I am a strong believer in the development of skills and the importance they have in our everyday lives, which is why in high school I joined clubs such as jazz band, drumline, and leadership that aid such process. I have also volunteered at an animal shelter where I was in charge of taking care of animals, providing adoption counseling, and socializing animals . This environment was a change of pace but ultimately further helped me establish fundamental skills that I had not yet made progress on. I am also bilingual but despite the level at which I know another language, volunteering has allowed me to interact with others and further aid me with my communication skills. 
I am resilient, efficient and fast learner, I have been able to develop these skills by working in different environments that taught me the importance of hard work. I have worked at a few different places that taught me about teamwork and the importance of communication. For example I have worked a few different jobs that were good for my development as not only a worker but also a person. Working at Coco's bakery was important for my growth in customer service and communication as I constantly interacted with guests. Working there also helped me develop my skills with providing excellent customer service as we were constantly busy and expected to provide our best service to each and every customer, regardless of how busy it was. Also, having been able to experience not only working at little Caesars but also Pizza Hut has taught me a lot about efficiency and teamwork as I'm constantly working alongside others in a fast paced environment. The experience that I have gained from working these jobs is beginning to pay off as within a month of working at Pizza Hut, I was offered a shift leader position as a result of my hardwork and effort 
Moving on from work experience, clubs at school have had a big impact on laying the foundation of responsibility and teamwork. When I was part of the jazz band and drumline at my school I was exposed to a domain that was different to the usual school responsibilities. These clubs presented me with a level of liability as others counted on me to do my part through the contribution of an equal level or respect and effort. I was also able to learn about timeliness and committing myself to a project for a long period of time as I was constantly expected to show up to after school practice multiple times a week. I've been able to develop certain work and life skills through all of these different experiences that have prepared for what's to come in the future. A plethora of environments and unique guest experiences are reason to all the skills that I have acquired over the years.
